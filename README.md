# tory-meter

first foray in to machine learning - the initial idea is to use [BrainJS](https://github.com/BrainJS) to detect whether some news article content is right wing or not.

## testing

```bash
npm test
```

## running

```bash
npm run
```

### todo

lots:

* identify data source fortraining model
* define criteria for marking article as right-wing in sentiment
* train model
* add service to detect sentiment
